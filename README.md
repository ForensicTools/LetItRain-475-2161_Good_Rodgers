# LetItRain
**Cloud Storage Positive/Negative Hashing**

## About
This tool will take credentials or an API key for a cloud storage provider as input (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) and download all available info (current files, deleted files, and file versions) from that provider. The data will be sorted into an easy-to-navigate directory structure, and both positive and negative hashing will be performed with a user-provided hash database. The tool will report with all matching "bad" hashes as well as which files that can be safely ignored. Available metadata for each file will be downloaded and stored in an easily accessible format.
